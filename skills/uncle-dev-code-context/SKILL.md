# skill:context-manager

## Does exactly this

Enforces mandatory context workflow: read local AGENTS.md files before edits, respect architecture boundaries, and update context docs after structural changes.

---

## When to use

Apply this skill when a task includes any of the following:

- Editing files.
- Creating, moving, or deleting source directories.
- Changing dependencies between architectural layers.

## Required Workflow

1. Identify all directories that will be edited.
2. For each directory, check whether `AGENTS.md` exists.
3. If `AGENTS.md` exists, read it before editing.
4. If `AGENTS.md` does not exist and the directory contains source files, create documentation context first.
5. Validate dependency direction against architecture boundaries.
6. Perform edits.
7. If structure, entrypoints, or boundaries changed, update the affected `AGENTS.md` files in the same turn.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and fix context before proceeding if any of these occur:

- Editing starts before reading applicable `AGENTS.md`.
- A new source directory is added without context documentation.
- A dependency violates layer boundaries.
- Architectural changes are made without updating context docs.

## Execution Checklist

- [ ] Confirm imports respect architecture boundaries.
- [ ] Apply code changes.
- [ ] Update context documentation for structural changes.
